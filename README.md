# ENG 685: Language-Identification-and-Text-Classification-for-English-Vietnamese-Data-Using-NLTK

# Project Description
The project focuses on English-Vietnamese text analysis, which involves detecting the language of a sentence and classifying it into one of three topics: News, Sports, or Entertainment. The input text may be fully English, fully Vietnamese, or a mixture of both. Language detection is based on identifying Vietnamese diacritics and English words, while classification relies on predefined keyword lists for each category in both languages. The main objective of the system is to accurately determine the language and assign the appropriate topic. This rule-based approach is useful for processing multilingual content and can support applications such as social media analysis, bilingual chatbots, content moderation, and educational tools for language learners.
